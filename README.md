# Stock-Market-Comparison-Analysis-using-Python

#Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis and comparison of different stock market indices and individual stocks using Python. The goal is to help investors and analysts understand market trends, correlations, and the performance of various stocks over time. By leveraging Python's data analysis libraries, this project offers visual insights and quantitative metrics to make informed investment decisions.

#Features

Data Collection: Automatically fetches historical stock data from sources like Yahoo Finance using APIs.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing data, outliers, and formats data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes time-series analysis, moving averages, and statistical summaries.
Stock Comparison: Compares multiple stocks or indices side by side, highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs) such as ROI, volatility, and correlation.
Visualization: Offers various charts (line, bar, candlestick) to visualize stock trends and comparisons over different time periods.
Machine Learning Models: Implements basic prediction models like Linear Regression and ARIMA to forecast future stock prices.
Backtesting: Provides a simple backtesting framework to test investment strategies based on historical data.
